These run files should be located in the directory app_root/config/service

The service directory should be 755 (chmod -R 755 app_root/config/service)

They should be symlinked OR copied into /service (by default you must be root):
  ln -s /path/to/app/conf/service /service/app_name
  cp -r /path/to/app/conf/service /service/app_name

Usage notes:
  after symlink, service starts within 5 seconds
  take service down: svc -d /services/app_name
  bring service up: svc -u /services/app_name
  list status of all services: svstat /services/*
