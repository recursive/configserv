Assumed setup (I'm using ArchLinux):

  rvm installed in server mode
    bash < <( curl -L http://bit.ly/rvm-install-system-wide )

  nginx installed
    pacman -S nginx

  unicorn installed in global gemset
    rvm use 1.9.2-p180@global --default
    gem install bundler unicorn
    rvm wrapper ruby-1.9.2-p180 global unicorn

  daemontools 0.76 installed
    mkdir ~/build; cd ~/build
    curl -O http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/daemontools/daemontools.tar.gz
    tar xzf daemontools.tar.gz; cd daemontools; makepkg
    pacman -U daemontools-0.76-3-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

  unicorn user exists (to run both nginx and unicorn) with rvm setup
    useradd --home /path/to/example --create-home --groups rvm unicorn
    chmod g+w /path/to/example
    echo 'source /usr/local/lib/rvm' >> /path/to/example/.bashrc

Conventions:

  nginx files are stored in /etc/nginx
  unicorn files are located in app_root/config/unicorn.rb
  rackup files are located in app_root/config.ru
  application specific service file is located in app_root/config/service/run
  application specific service directory and contents is 755 (chmod -R 755 dir)
  server services directory is located at /services/
  each application has a .rvmrc that states the ruby version and the gemset
  each application uses 'bundle install --deployment' when possible
